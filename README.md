# Intro to Redux

## Requirements

- [] Read and analyze the app structure.
- [] User can add product to the cart.
- [] User can remove product from the cart only when there are products with the same id in the cart.
- [] The cart shows total price and price of each product in the cart.
- [] Implement the same features but use Redux.

## Optional

- [] Instead of using <ProductOne>, <ProductTwo>, <CartProductOne>, <CartProductTwo>, let's create <Product> and <CardProduct> that are generated from the data in products and cart.products using map().
